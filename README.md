# AsteroBreaker

## Description

AsteroBreaker is an easy to play but hard to master arcade game. Your main goal is to shoot the asteroids with your spaceship while it bounces around a trampoline.

### Controls:
 
- **Move your cursor** to change the trampoline’s position.
- **Left and Right Arrow Keys** to move your spaceship.
- Shoot with the **Left Mouse Button**.

### Mechanics:

#### Trampoline 
Every time your spaceship comes in contact with this platform, it’ll bounce right up! Be careful though, if you ever miss that platform and fall through the stage, it’s game over.

#### Asteroids 
Shoot an asteroid to gain some points!

There are 3 different colors you will find through your journey:

- **White:** The weakest asteroid. Moves really slowly and gives you almost no points

- **Yellow:** A tougher version of the white asteroid. Moves in a decent pace and gives you a few more points

- **Red:** The toughest of them all. It’s extremely quick, but thankfully gives you tons of points

If you get hit by any of these asteroids, or let them fall through, you will lose one of your lives.

#### Friendly ships 
Do not attack the ships that look like you! If you hit them or come in contact with them you will lose one of your lives!

#### Airplane 
Be careful with this nasty obstacle. It’ll come from either side of the screen and move horizontally. If you get hit by it you’ll for sure lose another one of your lives!

#### Potion 
Thankfully if you ever lose any of your lives you can get them back by these randomly generated potions! Just touch them at any point and you’ll get one life back.
